<h1>My Computer Science Autobiography</h1>
<p>I started an interest in Computer Science when I was playing around on my old Windows XP Computer. I would enjoy uploading things, downloading things, and I sometimes 
would open it up to look at the circuits and wires. It was a big and bulky computer, and it looked something like this:</p>

<p>This interest in Computer Science continued to grow until this computer ended up dying sometime in 2010. From then on I started to lose interest in computers.
Until I met a man named <a href="http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~klassner/">Dr. Frank Klassner</a> in 2015. At the time, I was working at <a href="http://gpsr.nepabsa.org/">Goose Pond Scout Reservation</a>. 
Dr. Klassner is a professor at <a href="https://www1.villanova.edu/university.html">Villanova University</a>, and he brought in a project he was working on with his students.
Dr. Klassner brought in a Virtual Reality Sandbox, and he showed me how it worked through coding and calibrations. That brought that spark of computers back to me,
and at that time, I was starting to think about what I wanted to do after I graduated high school. This path down Computer Science became what I wanted to do in life,
however, it didn't start here at King's College. I started my first semester of college in South Carolina, at a school called <a href="https://go.citadel.edu/">The Citadel</a>
The Citadel is a military school, and I went down there as a Computer Science Major. I learned to program with Java in their Computer Science Department. Over the course of the time I was there, the difficulties
of military life set in and I was not able to return after I completed my first semester due to mental health concerns. So I ended up transferring to King's in the Spring Semester
of 2021, and I have been here ever since. Despite my past exeperiences, I am not letting those hardships bring me down, and I refuse to let those first months of my Freshman year
set me up for failure throughout the rest of my college career. I hope to graduate in the Computer Science Department of King's College in 2024, and I will hopefully find a job in a
major web coorporation, like Google or Facebook.</p>
